		<p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://ischool.washington.edu/">Information School</a> at the <a href="http://uw.edu/">University of Washington</a>.  I study digital government and public engagement. I'm particularly interested how online participation systems allow the public to take part and have a voice in government and understanding the different factors, both internal and external, that impact their development and implementation. I have earned degrees in International Studies, and Liberal Studies, with a focus on public policy and technology, from <a href="http://nku.edu/">Northern Kentucky University</a></p>

		<p>I also study viral information flows as a member of the <a href="http://retrov.org/">retroV research team</a>.<p>

		<p> My advisors are <a href="http://ekarine.org">Karine Nahon</a> and Emma Spiro.</p>
